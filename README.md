# HeartSafe: Predicting Sudden Cardiac Arrest Risk 💓📊

This project analyzes patient medical data to identify individuals at risk of Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA). Using data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning classification (KNN), we built a risk assessment model based on real patient indicators such as age, cholesterol, resting ECG, chest pain type, and exercise-induced angina.

## 📌 Objective

To build an interpretable, accurate model that can help healthcare professionals assess the likelihood of sudden cardiac arrest based on clinical features.
